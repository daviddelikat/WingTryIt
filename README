this project was created using Wing

https://github.com/plainblack/Wing

NOTE that I did not use the documented method for 
installing Wing ( see README in the Wing repository )
I trimmed it significantly and used my own local perl
and mysql because I was having too many conflicts
with the system applications.  I will likely create
a fork of Wing with the scripts that I used or at least
some description of it.

The following commands were used to create this project;
much of the text is copied directly from the Wing README
and filled in with my working parameters.

source /data/Wing/bin/dataapps.sh

1. Create a project:

  cd /data/Wing/bin
  export WING_HOME=/data/Wing
  perl wing_init_app.pl --app=TryIt

2. Create a database on your MySQL server to host the project, and edit the Wing config to match:

  mysql -uroot -p -e "create database tryit;grant all privileges on tryit.* to tryit@localhost identified by 'tryit';flush privileges;" 

  vi /data/TryIt/etc/wing.conf  
  # edit the "db" section and add the username and password.

 vi /data/TryIt/etc/log4perl.conf
    # edit path for log ( not required if app will run as root user )

3. Initialize the database:

  cd /data/TryIt/bin
  export WING_HOME=/data/Wing
  export WING_APP=/data/TryIt/
  export WING_CONFIG=/data/TryIt/etc/wing.conf
  perl $WING_HOME/bin/wing_db.pl --install --ok

4. Start up the rest server and/or web server:

  cd /data/TryIt/bin
  ./start_rest.sh  &
  ./start_web.sh  &

5. Now you can connect to the rest server and see if it's alive:

   curl http://localhost:5000/api/status

   curl http://localhost:5001/account

 NOTE: By default there is one user named 'Admin' with a password of '123qwe'.

6. We also provide you with an nginx config file to give you a baseline for serving your apps. You can start it like this:

    sudo nginx -c /data/TryIt/etc/nginx.conf
